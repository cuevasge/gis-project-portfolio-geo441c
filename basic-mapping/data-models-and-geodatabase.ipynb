The geodatabase stores a collection of feature datasets, which each contain a set of feature classes that share the same coordinate system. Feature datasets allow us to organize our data and use more advanced functions, such as Topology and Terrain data. Our geodatabase is how we begin to organize our GIS designs.\n",
